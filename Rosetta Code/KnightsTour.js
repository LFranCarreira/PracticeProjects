// Knight's Tour Problem: You have an empty width * height chessboard, but for a single knight on some square.
// The knight must perform a sequence of legal moves that result in the knight visiting every square on the chessboard exactly once.
// Note that it is not a requirement that the tour be "closed"; that is, the knight need not end within a single move of its start position.
